PROJECT: Rube Goldberg Game


Name: Waad Fahad



Tested Platform: Oculus Rift



Note: 
I didn't upload the build file as it was large.


if you build the game, it will only work on Rift 
as the new STEAMVR doesn't allow me to bind 
a not plugged-in controller. 



so, 
If you're testing on Vive, 
please do the following before building 



1. Go to Window -> STEAMVR Input -> Open binding UI



2. uncheck the mirror option 



3. In the right trackpad click on the + sign and choose use as a "trackpad."



4. Fill click, touch, and position as below



Click: Spawn 

Touch: Menudisplay

Position: Menuswipe




Then you're good to go :) 

Make a new build, and it should work





Note:

The game is beatable even though it might make you some time. Sorry for that :)
